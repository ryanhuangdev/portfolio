I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a Computer Science degree in Spring 2016 and has been working ever since. I was introduced to programming in middle school when I developed a private server for a popular game. The many possibilities I was able to create by tweaking a few lines of code had me intrigued to dive deeper into learning how it all worked. I was always more of a visual programmer and that translated into my current work which deals with mostly front-end work for a payroll product that is used globally. I am a bleeding edge tech kind of a guy and am always up to date on the new tech stacks and just general consumer technology.
